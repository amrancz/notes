title: Product vision describes the aspirational future state of a product
---

Product vision is a way of communicating where we want the product to be in several years. It should inspire and motivate product teams. It can be a prototype (visiontype), storyboard or a narrative.

Vision inspires and sets the direction, while [[Product strategy defines the path towards the product vision]].

Product teams inside an organization need a vision so that they're work is aligned under it.

The concept is very similar (if not identical) to what Tanner Christensen calls "the product narrative".
