title: First principles thinking
---

Thinking from first principles is opposed to thinking by analogy.

Here, you don't view something by likening it to something else. Instead, you break things down into the most fundamental truths. You can then build up your thinking from there.

This is especially useful for complex concepts or problems where analogies stop short of being useful: [[Metaphor usefulness declines with concept complexity]]

First principles thinking can be used to break down complex problems so that you can come up with innovative solutions that aren't burdened by the status quo.

Some techniques to use when thinking from first principles include the Five Whys or Socratic questioning.
