title: Read in two phases to limit wasting time and to increase knowledge
---

When you start reading a book, you don't know how valuable it's going to be.
Reading slowly and thoroughly might be a waste of time.

Reading in two phases helps with filtering out content that's not useful and engaging more with the content that is. Thus increasing knowledge in the end.

This is also called "the barbell method of reading". The two phases are:
- 1) Read quickly. Mark parts and passages that are useful or difficult to understand (or both).
- 2) Read again but only the marked parts. Read thoroughly, make notes. Then reflect and make permanent notes. [[Write about what you read]].
