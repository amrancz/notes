title: Feature teams
---

In most companies, product teams are there just to deliver features. While they're still cross-functional, they are not empowered to discover the solutions themselves. They are not held accountable to outcomes and results, only to delivering features (preferably on time).

Contrast that with [[Empowered teams]] which is the ideal model for cross-functional product teams.

In feature teams, the Product Manager is usually doing more project management work. In many companies, they hold the Product Owner title.
