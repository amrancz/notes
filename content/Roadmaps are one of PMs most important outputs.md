title: Roadmaps are one of PMs most important outputs
---

Roadmaps are one of PMs most important outputs but their purpose and usage differ between external and internal roadmaps:
- External is partly for showing commitment to existing customers (especially in enterprise where customers buy into the future of the product) but also to attract new customers to upcoming capabilities.
- Internal roadmaps look different. They're for aligning teams and allocating resources. They're more for planning, they can be more tactical.

Customer input should *inform* the roadmap, not define it.
