title: People prefer rounded objects

People subconsciously prefer objects with rounder shapes. 

In a study "Humans Prefer Curved Visual Objects by Moshe Bar and Maital Neta (2006)" participants were shown hundreds of pairs of sharp or curved neutral objects, patterns and fonts. They were flashed up for 84ms. A second is 1000 milliseconds. This is to capture the most unfiltered, System 1, perception.

In every case, people liked curved objects more.
