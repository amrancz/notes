title: Write about what you read
---

Reflection is an important part of reading. It increases the knowledge you extract from the content.

You think by writing. So it's a good way of reflecting on what you read.

Practically, this means [[note-taking]] â€“ not just transient notes (highlights, margin notes) while reading but also permanent notes ([Zettelkasten](zettelkasten.de), [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C)) when reflecting on the read content.
