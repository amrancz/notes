title: Embodied cognition
---

Embodied cognition (or embodiment) is a view in cognitive science that says that body and mind are very much connected. That's in contrast to previous thinking that the mind is a separate entity.

Embodied cognition says that the body shapes our mind and our thinking. Our thinking depends on our bodies.

In other words, [[Action isn't a result of thinking. It's a medium for thinking.]]
