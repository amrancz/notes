title: Embodied cognition
---

Embodied cognition (or embodiment) is a view in cognitive science that says that body and mind are very much connected. That's in contrast to previous thinking that the mind is a separate entity.

Embodied cognition says that the body shapes our mind and our thinking. Our thinking depends on our bodies.

It's still a theory, though, and hasn't been fully confirmed to be the ultimate truth about the nature of the mind.
