- Weak product companies:
	- Lack product vision and strategy
	- Don't give teams the autonomy to solve meaningful problems
	- Don't offer their technology teams any coaching and don't staff them properly
	- View EPD teams as "just serving the business" as opposed to serving the customer

- While those companies may want to transform, they don't know how.

- Company culture is often a reflection of founders' personalities.
	- However, culture alone doesn't lead to building successful products.

- "Leadership is about recognizing that there's a greatness in everyone and your job (as an executive) is to create an environment where that greatness can emerge." – Bill Campbell

- 3 key differences separating the best product companies:
	- How it views the role of technology:
		- It's not a necessary expense that just serves the business. It IS the business.
	- Role of product leaders
		- Hiring great people, coaching them, creating a solid product strategy for them and generally helping them achieve great outcomes. Not about "command and control".
		- Focused and compelling product vision and strategy, grounded in qualitative and quantitative insights, is one of the most important contributions from product leadership.

	- How it views the purpose of product teams:
		- Delivering products that customers love yet work for the business. Not just "serving the business".
