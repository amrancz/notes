title: Actively working with information enables learning
---

Learning is really about actively working with the information/knowledge at hand, rather than passively consuming it (e.g. re-reading, cramming). "Actively" means:
- **Translating** into your own words (i.e.[[Write about what you read]])
- Trying to **recall** the information (even if without success at first)
- Making **connections** to existing knowledge
	- [[Learning best happens by making connections]]

This is one reason why [[Zettelkasten]] is also great for learning.
