title: Understanding requires more work than passive consumption of information
---

Access and consumption of information doesn't immediately lead to understanding.
We must work with the information to **create** understanding.
That creation happens through associations, visual representations and interactions.

It is the responsibility of the information creator/presenter to make it as understandable as possible. But it's also the responsibility of the consumer to actively engage with it. The creator cannot make any information understandable for everyone because everyone is different and has different needs about what to do with the information.

This idea is very close to [[Actively working with information enables learning]]
