This book is about product management for enterprise SW. It's about B2B as opposed to B2C.

- [[Building products for companies (B2B) is very different from building for consumers (B2C)]]
- [[Types of knowledge that product managers need]]

Successfuly PMs need several types of knowledge:
- Organizational
- Product
- Industry
(Compare this with Cagan who specifies business, customer, data and industry types of knowledge)

- PMs need to effectively communicate with executives
