title: Understanding is shaped by all kinds of sensory information
---

We use all kinds of sensory information (from vision through hearing to tactile) to learn and understand. Understanding is based on the available sensory information.

Because we use all senses, it explains why physical interactions or learning with the whole body help with understanding.

In the context of design, manipulating that sensory information (e.g. what someone sees on a website) will alter perceptions.
