title: Information encoded in long-term memory are remembered for a very long time
---

People have a very good long-term memory. Once an information passes the previous bottelnecks of attention and working memory, and is encoded to long-term memory, it stays there for a very long time. That's in contrast with [[Working memory is subject to quick decay and displacement]]

And even when people cannot actively recall something they've seen or heard, they'll be able to recognize quickly. (see [[Recognition over recall]]).
