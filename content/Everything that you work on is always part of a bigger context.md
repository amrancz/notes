Everything that you work on is always part of a bigger context. This context matters in design.

[[Always tie your work to goals and objectives.]]

Eero Saarinen said:
"Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context — a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan."

And Robert Green, writes in Mastery:
"Your project or the problem you are solving should always be connected to something larger — a bigger question, an overarching idea, an inspiring goal. "
