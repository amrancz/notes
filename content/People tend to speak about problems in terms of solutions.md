title: People tend to speak about problems in terms of solutions
---

People naturally think and talk in terms of solutions instead of the underlying problems.
When you talk to users about their problems, they'll typically describe a solution.
Or then users come to you with feedback or questions, it will often be around a specific solution.

Your job as a designer is to uncover the underlying need or problem (e.g. I need to hang a picture on the wall) behind the described solution (e.g. I need a drill to make a hole).

Always [[Uncover the need behind a feature request]]
