title: Acceptable-expensive-prohibitive pricing points
---

There are usually three pricing points:
1. Acceptable (low-ball): this is usually a cheap price that customers are really comfortable with paying. Can be a good pricing strategy for growth.
2. Expensive (ceiling): what people are actually willing to pay but without being too happy about it.
3. Prohibitive (cut-off): what's the tipping point where people consider the price way too high.

One way of testing for these points is presenting potential customers the product (or its prototype or landing page) and asking:
1) What do you think is an acceptable price for this innovation?
2) What is an expensive price for this innovation?
3) What is a prohibitively expensive price for this innovation?

The questions uncover low-ball (acceptable), ceiling (expensive) and cut-off (prohibitive) prices, in this order.

It's ideal to do a large study with customers and gather lots of data. They can show you pricing cliffs.
