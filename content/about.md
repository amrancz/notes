title: My Digital Garden
---

Hi, I'm Adam Amran ðŸ‘‹

This is my digital garden â€“ a place for my notes and thoughts.

I'm just starting out building this place so there's not much yet. 
There's no fixed structure either, the system is associative. 

Best places to start exploring is:
- what's on [[$Top of my mind]]
- my [[$Areas of interest]]

This is heavily inspired by Andy Matuschak's [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) and the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/).

The site is built with Gatsby and the [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy).
