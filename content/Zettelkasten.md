Zettelkasten is a [[note-taking]] system developed by Niklas Luhmann.
It is a system primarily for supporting writing (typically non-fiction or in academia).

It's a content-first system – it enables topics to emerge from the notes and the relationships between them.

The basic process of using zettelkasten is:
1. [[Write about what you read]]. 
	1. Make literature notes. Also make fleeting notes about whatever interesting comes up during your day.
2. Create permanent notes out of your literature and fleeting notes.
	1. [[Permanent notes should be concise and translated into your own words]]
	2. Keep them atomic (one idea per note).
	3. Keep them self-explanatory – it shouldn't require additional context when you come back to it later.
	4. Relate to existing knowledge and your own thinking.
	5. [[The main criteria for adding notes should be relevance and diversity]]
3. [[Connect new notes to existing ones]].
	1. Create relationships between ideas.
4. Pick topics for writing based on ideas that emerge from the relationships in the system.
5. Use your notes as support for writing drafts.

Zettelkasten is based on several principles:
- [[Circular process of writing]]
	- Never starting writing from scratch. Because you build a system of notes over time, you always have ideas emerge from it and always have enough material to work with.
- [[Taking smart notes creates a positive feedback loop in the writing process]].
	- The system propels itself forward. It becomes more useful and usable as it grows.
- Keeping the system simple.
	- Only having a few types of notes (fleeting, literature, permanent + perhaps project-related) and adhering to these fundamental principles.
