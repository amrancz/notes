title: Metaphor usefulness declines with increased concept complexity 
---

Metaphors work great for simple concepts. E.g. illustrating a relationship between two objects by the thickness of the connecting line.

The more complex the topic, however, the more dangerous the usage of a single metaphor. This is how [[Metaphors can be a double-edged sword]].

As one metaphor triggers only a particular set of associations, it cannot possibly capture all the useful and correct associations for a complex concept. It can even trigger associations leading us to have false assumptions or faulty reasoning.

In that case, it's necessary to employ [[First principles thinking]], be very much aware of the metaphor/analogy used, and bring in more metaphors for different points of view ([[Plurality of perspectives create better understanding]])
