title: Just-in-time design
---

There are benefits to providing design specifications just in time for development.
Just-in-time means:
- in small iterations
- only what is needed
- multiple times per sprint to support the sprint goal

Providing one big design upfront (e.g. at the beginning of a sprint) means that design cannot benefit from team's learning and needs throughout the sprint. As engineering discovers more during the sprint, design should respond. Close collaboration is necessary.

This also helps to avoid creating a backlog of design because designs age very quickly.
