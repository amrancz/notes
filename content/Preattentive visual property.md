title: Preattentive visual property
---

Pre-attentive visual properties of objects are processed in our brain before we can consciously think about them. This usually happens in <500ms, often in ~200ms.

Processing these properties so quickly helps us recognize patterns very fast and understand things without making conscious effort. This is also because [[Vision is the dominant sense]]

Designers need to be aware of pre-attentive visual properties to use them purposefully. These properties can be used to make something stand out or to help people recognize patterns.

There are 4 kinds of these properties:
- Color
- Form
- Movement (flicker and motion)
- Position in space 

Form includes:
-  Collinearity
-   Curvature
-   Length, breadth and width
-   Marks added to objects
-   Numerosity
-   Shape
-   Size
-   Spatial grouping
-   Spatial orientation

There's a nice table of different visual properties with suggestion on their best type of use: https://poetpainter.com/visual-encodings.pdf
