Value is more important than usability or performance. If a product or feature doesn't bring value, it doesn't matter that i's fast and easy to use because people won't have a reason to use it.

On the other hand, if a product brings value (satisfies the need of a user/customer) then its users will tolerate some usability or performance issues. Only to a certain degree, of course.

This also explains why [[Building the right thing is a foundation of good design]].
