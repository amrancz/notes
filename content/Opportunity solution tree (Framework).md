title: Opportunity solution tree (Framework)
---

Opportunity solution tree is a framework for mapping "opportunities" (customer needs, pains, desires) and possible solutions + experiments, identified during [[Product discovery]].

It starts with the product outcome we want to drive. Product outcome should be a change in customer behavior that will help drive a business outcome.

In OST, you then map opportunities in a tree structure: capture parent-child relationships. This helps break down larger opportunities into smaller ones that you can address separately, iteratively. You can deliver value over time.

Opportunities in the tree should be distinct from each other. One way to do that is to capture key moments in time based on stories from customer interviews.

Only add opportunities that:
- will drive your outcome
- you heard from multiple customers
- are framed as needs/pains/desires and not solutions
	- Be aware of this since [[People tend to speak about problems in terms of solutions]]. An opportunity should have more possible solutions. If it has just one, it's probably a solution in disguise.

OSTs should be refined over time as product teams continuously interview.

Since [[Product teams should prioritize opportunities, not solutions]], this framework lends itself well to them.
