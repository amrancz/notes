title: Old designs do not become obsolete with new technologies
---

Good design stands on solid foundations and thus doesn't necessarily become obsolete when new technologies come around.

[[Jobs to be done are relatively stable over time]].

To practice [[user interface design]], one must study not only the current guidelines but also the history and key moments of the field. We should learn from the past. Older designs can be relevant and we can (and should) take inspiration from them.
