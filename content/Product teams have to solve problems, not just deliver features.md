title: Product teams have to solve problems, not just deliver features
---

Focus of product teams should be on outcomes (solving problems) instead of outputs (delivering features). This [[Outcomes over outputs]] mindset is key.

The job of a product team is to create customer value in a way that creates value for the business (e.g. solving a problem that customer is willing to pay for).

[[Product teams need context in order to best solve problems for the business autonomously]].
