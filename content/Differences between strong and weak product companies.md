		- It's not a necessary expense that just serves the business. It IS the business.
	2. **Role of product leaders**
		- Hiring great people, coaching them, creating a solid product strategy for them and generally helping them achieve great outcomes. Not about "command and control".
		- Focused and compelling product vision and strategy, grounded in qualitative and quantitative insights, is one of the most important contributions from product leadership.

	3. **How it views the purpose of product teams**:
