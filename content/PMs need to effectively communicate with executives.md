title: PMs need to effectively communicate with executives
---

PMs regularly need to report to executives. They need to be effective in the communication with them in order to have the execs' support for their work.

There are typically 3 things execs will need to hear:
- Status: how we're standing with current projects/iniatives
- Roadmap: where we're going
- Strategy: are we doing the right things

PMs should speak to what execs care about. Tactics for effective communication here include:
- Tie things to company's product vision and business objectives
- Tell a story supported by data
