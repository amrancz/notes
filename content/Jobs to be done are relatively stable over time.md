title: Jobs to be done are relatively stable over time
---

People's core needs (i.e. jobs to be done) remain roughly the same over time.

Technologies may come and go, but the need remains the same. Good example is getting from point A to point B. That's a fundamental human need and it doesn't change with technological advances: horses, carriages, trains, cars, airplanes...all answer this need.

Because jobs to be done are stable, old designs (especially in [[user interface design]]) can teach us about them.
[[Old designs do not become obsolete with new technologies]]
