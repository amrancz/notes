title: Ill-structured vs. well-structured problems
---

Problems are generally hierarchical. Solving a mundane problem (e.g. finding a specific email) is usually part of a larger problem (which is part of an even larger problem etc.)

Lower-level problems tend to be more well-structured. Herb Simon defined "well-structured" problems as fullfilling these criteria:
- Includes criteria to test the solution and repeatable process for applying the criteria.
- There's a clear problem state, goal state and interim states
- Has identifiable "legal moves" – clear steps to take to solve the problem. These require only practical levels of effort.

The larger the problem, the more ill-structured it tends to be.
Design problems and problems related to innovation in business are pretty much always ill-structured.

[[Humans have unique techniques to solve ill-structured problems]].
