title: Placing objects in space reflects our understanding of a given concept
---

How we arrange/place/sort objects in space, reveals our understanding (internal representation, "mental model") of a given concept.

This is the idea that powers the method of [[Card sorting]] in user research.

Placing things in space reveals how we think about the categories, relationships etc.: by revealing the "territories" (see [[Visual models are "Objects Placed into Territories"]]).

Could this idea be the key to reveal mental models during user research. (see [[Mental models in design]]).
