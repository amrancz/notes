title: Product manager's job is to decide what to build next
---

A product manager is responsible for deciding what to build next in a product. 

In order to do that, the PM has to make sure that the feature of the product they're building is:
- **valuable** (answers a user need – whether functional or emotional one)
- **usable** (people can learn to use it quickly and can use it often without problems)
- **feasible** (the company is able to build it with reasonable amount of resources)
- **viable for the business** (the company can support it and it fits into company's strategy)

A starting point for the PM when prioritizing is usually the company's strategy. They'll have objectives to achieve and will ask "Will X help the company achieve this?"

After this prioritization, it's about collaborating with others: [[Product management is an operational role]]
