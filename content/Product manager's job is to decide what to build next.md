title: Product manager's job is to decide what to build next
---

A product manager is responsible for deciding what to build next in a product. In order to do that, the PM has to make sure that the feature of the product they're building is:
- **valuable** (answers a user need â€“ whether functional or emotional one)
- **usable** (people can learn to use it quickly and can use it often without problems)
- **feasible** (the company is able to build it with reasonable amount of resources)
