title: People need novel experiences to stay engaged
---

Seeing or recognizing a stimulus elicits a response (e.g. seeing a picture of a classmate brings up a nostalgic emotion). However, there's such a concept of *extinction* of that response.

Encountering something for the first time elicits the biggest reponse. Each subsequent encounter elicits a smaller one. It diminishes.

This then means that people need novel experiences to stay engaged. I.e. people won't experience the same engagement when re-watching a movie (and much less when re-watching for the 3rd time).

Because [[Information encoded in long-term memory are remembered for a very long time]], re-experiencing something even after long time doesn't lead to the same engagement.
