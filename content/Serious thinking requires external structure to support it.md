title: Serious thinking requires external structure to support it
---

Thinking cannot be only a purely internal mental process because of the limitations of the mind. External structures (like [[Zettelkasten]]) are necessary to support serious thinking. They enable to make more meaningful connections and not rely on our ability to retrieve information (which is limited). And because [[Learning best happens by making connections]], this external structure also supports learning.
