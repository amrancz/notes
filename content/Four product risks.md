title: Four product risks
---

There are four main risks that product teams have to deal with when building something:

1) Value risk: Will customers buy this and will users decide to use it?
2) Usability risk: Can people figure out how to use it?
3) Feasibility risk: Can we build this?
4) Business viability risk: Is this solution viable for our business?

These risks are usually tackled via [[Product discovery]].

Often, the risks are low and teams can proceed to delivery. But when the answers aren't clear, that's when discovery is very important.

Out of the four, value risk is the most important mitigate. Because [[Establishing value is more important than eliminating every usability issue or having the best performance]]. If the value isn't there, the rest doesn't matter.

Usability risk is best tackled through [[Usability testing]].
