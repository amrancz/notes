title: Prototype theory in product design
---

As we experience different instances of various UI controls over time, we form a prototype of each in our mind (based on size, shape, color etc.).

"The more we experience a certain kind of control, the more solid our prototypical representation of that control will become."

Also, the more similar two prototypes of different categories become, the more confusion can arise as people mistake one for the other.

There are also implications for information architecture â€“ the close to prototype of a category something is represented, the better can people recognize if what they're looking for can be found there.

Designing in accordance with prototype theory can help the UI be more obvious and intuitive.
