- Use short sentences and paragraphs. Long sentences are not helpful. Be mindful that you write these notes to last forever.
- Structure your notes:
	- Give them a descriptive title. Not just keywords, a normal sentence is fine.
	- Sum up the note in one first sentence.
	- Structure even shorter notes.
