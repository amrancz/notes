title: Concept mapping (method)
---

Concept mapping is a design synthesis method, best used for:
- building an understanding of a domain
- thinking through and illustrating a complicated idea/concept
- illustrating relationships between people, systems, or objects

It is basically a formal representation of the designer's mental model of a given concept. "A picture of understanding" (Kolko, 2007)

Process for creating a concept map:
- List all terms/entities that make up the concept (actors, objects, actions etc.)
- Prioritize the terms and organize them into a simple hierarchy
- Outline the structure of the map – spread out the terms/entities and connect them with verbs to illustrate relationships

This requires:
- A prior knowledge of the concept, built by doing research
- Using the language related to the knowledge (learned through research)
- Trusting the method, finding meaning in it (which leads to using it rigorously)
