title: Responsibilities of product leadership in strong product companies
---

Product leadership is crucial for making empowered teams work well. It is responsible for:
	- Creating a strong product vision. Such vision inspires everyone and even acts as a recruiting tool. [[Product vision describes the aspirational future state of a product]]
	- Creating and evangelizing a product strategy. [[Product strategy defines the path towards the product vision]] + [[Product leadership should give empowered teams a solid product strategy]]
	- Staffing product teams so that they are capable to work well.
	- Coaching members of product teams (helping them do better work by leveling up their skills, seeing how their work connects with other teams etc.)
	- Giving meaningful problems (objectives) that teams can go and solve instead of prescribing them solutions. [[Outcomes over outputs]]
	- Trusting the teams to solve problems on their own, not controlling them, but giving them the necessary context ([[Product teams need context in order to best solve problems for the business autonomously]])
