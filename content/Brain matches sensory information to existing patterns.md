title: Brain matches sensory information to existing patterns
---

When we say that [[Understanding is shaped by all kinds of sensory information]], it's not just having the information that creates understanding.

Our brains match that information with what we already know, with existing experience. The brain associates the incoming information with existing concepts: [[Associations between concepts is thinking]]

Brain is basically a pattern-matching & prediction organ.

To quote Anderson, Fast (2020): "*We see what we've seen before*".
