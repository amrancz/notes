title: Product intuition needs to be calibrated through research
---

Your intuition about your users, their needs and how to solve problems for them, is only as good as your knowledge of them.

If your user base is very similar to you, your intuition might be good without much effort.

If you have a specific user base that's very different from you, you need to spend a lot of time (months, sometimes even years) getting to know your users. That should ideally happen through user research but you can also gain insights from your teammates.

This process takes time so do not expect your product intuition to be any good from the start when you enter a new industry or design for a new user base. You have to calibrate it first.
