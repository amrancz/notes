title: In product management, there's very little standardization
---

The field of PM is farily young. It's also a very complex, operational job involving collaboration with many different teams and taking into account many different inputs. 

Therefore, there's little standardization in how it's done.

"No two companies will do product management in the same way" â€“ Blair Reeves, Building Products for the Enterprise

The standards are in higher level jobs: to prioritize, to align teams, but there are big differences in how PMs go about doing that.
