title: Working memory
---

- Working memory decays rapidly – we lose the information there in ~30sec unless we actively work to keep them available.
	- This trait is an issue in UX design when the user has to carry over some information from one part of the product to another.
	- Designers should ask "What information are we asking users to keep in their working memory, and how can we help them keep it from decaying?"
	- People work around this by using "phonological loop" – subvocally repeating the information to keep it from decaying.
	- Good products use their technical memory to free up users' working memory for other things than e.g. remembering a phone number they want to dial.
- Information in working memory are displaced rapidly – when working memory is at its capacity, existing information is pushed out as new information arrives.
	- Displacement is the problem behind distractions – when we e.g. receive a notification, that new information pushes out some of whatever we were storing in our working memory previously. And it's hard to get back to it.
		- [[People actively detect signal from noise]] and actively choose if something enters their working memory (// still unsure if this is completely correct)
- The process of transferring information from working memory to long-term memory is called "encoding". Most information we perceive is lost before it's encoded.
	- Working memory is the true bottleneck in this sense.

- Due to this bottleneck of working memory, multitasking isn't really possible. What we call multitasking is often monotasking with rapid switching.
	- This comes with the switching costs: it takes longer to finish two tasks done simultaneously (switching rapidly) than one after the other (Marois & Ivanoff, 2005, Dux et al, 2006).
- Multitasking is only possible with activities that are well-learned and don't take up much of our working memory when we perform them – they don't need conscious attention. E.g. driving a car. These are "automatic processes"
	- Automatic processes usually involve movement, while effortful processes involve processing of verbal information and logic.
	- We can perform two automatic processes at once, or one automatic process and one effortful process at once, but not two effortful processes at once.
