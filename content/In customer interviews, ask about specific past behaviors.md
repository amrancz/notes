title: In customer interviews, ask about specific past behaviors
---

Asking customers/users directly what they need or how they generally do X or how often they do X...all of that results in inaccurate answers.

It's better to ask specifically about past behavior.

When people don't know, they often default to a generalized or rationalized answer. People have a tendency to "rationalize our behavior even when we can't know the reason" (aka "left brain interpreter").

Asking about past behavior can help us uncover the reality.
