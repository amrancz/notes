title: Building products for companies (B2B) is very different from building for consumers (B2C)
---

The differences stem mostly from three areas:

**1) Business model**
**2) Product specialization & complexity**
**3) "Customers vs. users"**

Ad 1) B2B is typically more sales-driven. There are sometimes very long sales cycles and a lot of planning and evaluation goes into that process.

Ad 2) B2B software is often specialized to a serve a specific business or user need. But despite the specialization, there's often a lot of complexity due to a given domain (e.g. data management or CRMs). Over time, products often break beyond an initially specific use case and often grow to become platforms.

Enterprise specifically is often about selling a specialized solution to a sophisticated customer with a relatively small user base (compared to B2C)

Ad 3) In B2B, PMs must cater to these two groups of people that are very different. Customers (or buyers) often don't use the SW they buy but users can live in it daily.

Customers will have very different needs and requirements than users. Users might need efficiency to do their job well, customers might need to see ROI of buying the SW.

A B2B SaaS can have two very different strategies for selling:
1) Top down – winning "customers" (or "buyers") first
2) Bottom up – winning users first

This can dictate the focus target group for PMs work.
