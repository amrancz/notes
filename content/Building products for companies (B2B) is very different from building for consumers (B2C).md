title: Building products for companies (B2B) is very different from building for consumers (B2C)
---

The differences stem mostly from three areas:

**1) Business model**
**2) Product specialization & complexity**
**3) "Customers vs. users"**

Ad 1) B2B is typically more sales-driven. There are sometimes very long sales cycles and a lot of planning and evaluation goes into that process.

Ad 2) B2B software is often specialized to a serve a specific business or user need. But despite the specialization, there's often a lot of complexity due to a given domain (e.g. data management or CRMs). Over time, products often break beyond an initially specific use case and often grow to become platforms.

Enterprise specifically is often about selling a specialized solution to a sophisticated customer with a relatively small user base (compared to B2C)
