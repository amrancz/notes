title: Building products for companies (B2B) is very different from building for consumers (B2C)
---

The differences stem mostly from three areas:

1) Business model
2) Product specialization & complexity
3) "Customers vs. users"

Ad 1) B2B is typically more sales-driven. There are sometimes very long sales cycles and a lot of planning and evaluation goes into that process.

Ad 2) B2B software is often specialized to a serve a specific business or user need. But despite the specialization, there's often a lot of complexity due to a given domain (e.g. data management or CRMs). Over time, products often break beyond an initially specific use case and often grow to become platforms.

Ad 3) In B2B, PMs must cater to these two groups of people that are very different. Customers (or buyers) often don't use the SW they buy but users can live in it daily.
