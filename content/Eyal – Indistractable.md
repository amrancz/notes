- Most distractions start internally – as a psychological discomfort.
- Internal and external triggers can lead to traction (which moves us closer to our goals) or distractions (which moves us away from our goals)

- We bear some responsibility to manage distractions. It's not just up to the medium of the distractions to be responsible for it – e.g. an app or a social network.

- Our behavior is motivated by the desire to escape discomfort/pain. That's the root cause of internal distractions. We get distracted when we want to escape reality.
- - [[Internal distractions are caused by the desire to escape discomfort]]
- To manage our internal distractions, we must understand (and ultimately manage) the discomfort that's causing them.
- In this sense, [[Time management is pain management]]

Mastering internal distractions is about:
- reimagining the internal triggers -> being mindful of them + letting go, instead of resisting/suppressing
- reimagining the task (by making it more "fun" and focusing on it more intensely)
- reimagining our temperament

- What we believe determines how we behave.
	- Eyal asserts that ego depletion theory (as posited by Baumeister, 2011) doesn't apply (citing research by Dweck, 2013) -> Implying that we can have unlimited willpower unless we believe it's a limited resource.
	- If this is true – if ego depletion isn't a natural but self-created limitation – then we could persist in situations when we'd otherwise quit.
	- There's another view of willpower (proposed by Michael Inzlicht of University of Toronto): willpower acts like an emotion rather than a finite resource.
	- Self-talk plays an important role in creating beliefs about outselves: e.g. if we tell ourselves we have no self-control, we'll exert less of it! -> We need self-compassion.
