title: Content testing method
---

- Test your content on its own for understanding. 
- This is almost like a [[Usability testing]] but for content.
- Put in front of people, let them read it and have them highlight in green/red the parts that they understand (or make them confident or whatever your goal is) or not.
- Follow-up with "why" people describe things as helpful or unhelpful.
- This goes back to [[Associations between concepts is thinking]]: You want to uncover which parts of your content trigger helpful associations and which associations are perhaps missing altogether for people to understand.
- Ask what people expect to happen next â€“ uncovers expectations within a flow.
