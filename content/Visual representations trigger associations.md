title: Visual representations trigger associations
---

How something is represented visually will influence what concepts we associate with it (e.g. thin vs. thick lines suggesting relationship strength). Seemingly small details in these representations can influence associations – at least on an unconscious level.

Those associated concepts are developed by interacting with the world through our bodies: [[Embodied cognition]]. Some are rooted in nature, others in artificial things we interact with.

As [[Thinking is mostly unconscious]], so are these deep conceptual metaphors: e.g. we might not be conscious about the fact that we view a thick line between two objects as suggesting a strong relationship. But that doesn't take away from the fact that the association happens!

A lot of the associations triggered can be predictable – how exactly, though? And how does this differ among cultures? Are concepts rooted in nature more predictable than others?
