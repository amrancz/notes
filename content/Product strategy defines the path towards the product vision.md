title: Product strategy defines the path towards the product vision
---

Product strategy describes how the organization (or its part) is going to reach the product vision. It should be focused.
It needs to be aligned with the business strategy – it has to support the business goals.

In the words of Marty Cagan:
Product strategy should describe a sequence of products or releases (i.e. what the teams ship) that will push the organization toward its product vision.
