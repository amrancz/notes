title: Epistemic actions
---

There are two kinds of interactions: 
- pragmatic: acting toward a desired goal)
- epistemic: acting toward understanding).

Epistemic actions are actions that help us think or create understanding.
We can divide epistemic actions into four general themes:

1. Foraging
2. Tuning
3. Externalising
4. Constructing

### Foraging
Looking for resources that will lead to understanding. Includes *searching*, *probing*, *animating* and *collecting*

### Tuning
Adjusting resources to align with desired understanding. Includes *cloning*, *filtering*, *re-arranging* or *cutting*.

### Externalising
Moving resources from our heads into the world. Includes *annotating*, *linking* or *generating*.

### Constructing
Creating new knowledge structures in the world. Includes *composing*, *re-arranging* or *repicturing*.

Note that specific actions can be part of different themes based on context: e.g. re-arranging for tuning vs. constructing.
