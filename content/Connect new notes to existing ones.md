title: Connect new notes to existing ones
---

After creating a new note, think about how it relates to what you already have in the system. "What context do I want to find this in?"

Physically go through existing notes (not just in your memory!) and connect them with the new one. This is important so that the connections are meaningful and not just imagined ones.

This step allows you to make new connections and is vital for generating new ideas.

It's also important for learning: [[Learning best happens by making connections]]
