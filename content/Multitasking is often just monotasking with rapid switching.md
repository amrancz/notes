title: Multitasking is often just monotasking with rapid switching
---

Due to the bottleneck of [[Working memory is subject to quick decay and displacement]], what we call multitasking is often only monotasking with rapid switching.
	- This comes with the switching costs: **it takes longer to finish two tasks done simultaneously (switching rapidly) than one after the other** (Marois & Ivanoff, 2005, Dux et al, 2006).
- Actual multitasking is only possible with activities that are well-learned and don't take up much of our working memory when we perform them – they don't need conscious attention. E.g. driving a car. These are "automatic processes"
	- **Automatic processes usually involve movement, while "effortful processes" involve processing of verbal information and logic.**
	- **We can perform two automatic processes at once, or one automatic process and one effortful process at once, but not two effortful processes at once.**
