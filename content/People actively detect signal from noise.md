title: People actively detect signal from noise
---

- We actively determine if new information enters our working memory or is ignored based on how much signal it has: how much it's related and useful to our current goals or not.
	- In this way, we are active in that process of signal detection.
	- This is how displacement happens in working memory: [[Working memory is subject to quick decay and displacement]]
- David Green and John Sweet developed this as a "signal detection theory"
- We adjust our threshold for which information to let in: if we're more receptive, it comes with a cost of dealing with more noise. If we're less receptive, it comes with a cost of missing out on good signals.
- In the attention economy, it's crucial to be "sending good signals". Attention has a monetary value and is not to be traded away freely (Davenport & Beck, 2002)
- Ideally, people should be given the opportunity to reduce the amount of noise coming at them (e.g. adjust ads preferences).
