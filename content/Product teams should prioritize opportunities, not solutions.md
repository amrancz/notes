title: Product teams should prioritize opportunities, not solutions
---

Product teams must be outcome-focused (see [[Outcomes over outputs]]).
Focusing on solutions is focusing on outputs.
Instead, we need to focus on opportunities: stories of unmet customer needs, pain points and desires (basically [[jobs-to-be-done]]).

This is in line with the idea that [[Product teams have to solve problems, not just deliver features]].

One useful tool for doing this is the [Opportunity Solution Tree](https://www.producttalk.org/2016/08/opportunity-solution-tree/)

We need to compare opportunities by the impact they'll have on our outcomes. At some point, we need to commit to one, prototype a solution and see if it works.
