title: Focus on the outcome, not the output
---

Output is just means to an end. When we work on something, the goal is to create some kind of outcome: typically solve a problem for a customer or the business (or, ideally, both at the same time).

Creating a mockup is output. Shipping a feature is output. But when a customer's problem is solved, that's outcome.

Teams need to focus on the outcome because there may be several ways of achieving it. Especially when they hear feedback that "users need functionality X": [[People tend to speak about problems in terms of solutions]]. By focusing on the outcome, the team can come up with a better solution that the customer couldn't even imagine possible.
