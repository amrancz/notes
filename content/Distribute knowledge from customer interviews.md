title: Distribute knowledge from customer interviews
---

When talking to customers, it's very important that you don't create a learning bottleneck by talking to them alone and not sharing what you learn with the whole team.

Distributing the knowledge also helps to avoid the [[Curse of knowledge]] – if the whole team shares it, then it's less likely for misunderstandings to occur in communication that's based on that knowledge.

How do you achieve that distribution?
- Invite other team members to the interviews (2-3 people on your side is a good number, not more)
- Take good notes
- Review notes with your teammates right after the interviews
- Store the notes in a place where you can work with them and share them
- Share the notes with the rest of the team – use quotes, snippets etc.
