title: Recognition over recall
---

Design principle based on the fact that people are able to recognize things more easily than recall them from memory.

This is likely because encountering that information triggers associations immediately: [[Visual representations trigger associations]]

Recalling something takes more work. Recognition happens with good accuracy even long after first encoding some information, because [[Information encoded in long-term memory are remembered for a very long time]].
