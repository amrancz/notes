title: Validate designs in proportion to usability risk
---

Design should be validated in proportion to the usability risk there is.

It's not necessary to validate every design via [[Usability testing]] externally with users.
Some of it is enough to test with internal users – if you have them.
And for some things with low risk, it can be enough to validate with experts – e.g. other designers on the team.

Validate based on risk: low risk -> internal validation, high risk -> external validation.
