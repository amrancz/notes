title: Planning fallacy
---

People are overly optimistic when planning. They estimate a project will take much shorter than it then actually will.

This is exacerbated when people are eager to get an approval based on the time-estimate. In this case, decision makers should get an outside view to mitigate this.
"Reference class forecasting" (looking at actual data of how long a similar project actually took) can also help with this.
