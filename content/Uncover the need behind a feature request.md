title: Uncover the need behind a feature request
---

When people make a feature request, your job as a designer/researcher is to dig to understand the underlying need.

[[People tend to speak about problems in terms of solutions]] but the solution they have in mind may not be the best way to solve their problem.

Questions to ask when people make a feature request:
• Why do you need that?
• What would that enable you to do?
• How are you solving this today?

It's important that customer-facing roles understand this. By probing on feature requests, they can generate a lot of valuable insights for the product team.

You should also always follow-up on emotional signals (e.g. "this is the worst part of my day").
