title: Building the right thing is a foundation of good design
---

Good design consists of many layers. It has to be valuable, useful, usable, findable, accessible, credible and desirable.

But the most important layers are valuable and useful (Actually not sure about the difference between the two). That's what I mean by "the right thing" â€“ product and features that are valuable and useful to users. Stuff that answers their needs.

Yes, [[{WIP} User needs have functional and emotional dimensions]]. And products need to answer both dimensions.

But it's the functional dimension that's most important. That's what I mean by "valuable" and "useful". Product that is valuable and useful is meeting the functional dimension of user's needs.

If a feature doesn't meet the user need, nothing else about its design can make up for it. That's why building the right thing is a foundation of good design.
