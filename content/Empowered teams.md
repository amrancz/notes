title: Empowered teams

Empowered product teams are cross-functional teams who are given objectives with a desired outcome and then are accountable to achieving that outcome. In other words, [[Product teams have to solve problems, not just deliver features]].

Empowered teams are trusted to discover the best solutions and deliver them. But they're not judged by the output they produce but by the outcome they're able to achieve.

In this sense, [[Product teams should prioritize opportunities, not solutions]]

To be able to do the above [[Product teams need context in order to best solve problems for the business autonomously]] and [[Product leadership should give empowered teams a solid product strategy]] so that they can be successful.

In this model, the whole team collaborates to address the [[Four product risks]] together.

Empowered product teams is a sign that a company truly values [[Outcomes over outputs]]. This model is in contrast to [[Feature teams]].
