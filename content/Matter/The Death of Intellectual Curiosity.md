## Highlights
* curiosity-driven tinkering creates wealth in a positive-sum manner and is one of the main factors behind the economic growth of our society.
* lifelong learning is not something that academics can persuade people to do, rather it is a natural consequence of intellectual curiosity.
* how do we make people intellectual curious? We do not need to, they already are. More accurately, they used to be. You see this curiosity is in children. They are learning machines asking questions all day, trying to figure out everything. Now a curious person might wonder: Why are there not many more intellectually curious adults? And that is exactly the right question. We will see later how schools and universities destroy this quality in most people.
* mental models do not keep increasing in complexity. Things get simpler after putting enough time and energy into understanding them. This is known as simplicity on the other side of complexity.
* “sciences.”Students do not know what “real” learning feels like and that is a big problem; they do not know the difference between understanding and memorizing.
* In this race between broader knowledge and deeper explanations (how much one explanation can explain), depth seems to be coming out on top. It is now easier to understand all major theories than it was in ancient times. However, this is impossible if you only memorize.
* universities are less about learning than about mindless work and credentials. These credentials are not an indicator of how much a person has learned, rather they show how hard a person is willing to work to satisfy some arbitrary criteria.
* In big companies, individual contributions (value created) are hard to detect, which means more—hackable—metrics need to be used to assess employees. One of the results is that in tech companies today, people are still getting paid for the amount of time they put in, even though the output—the value they create—does not correlate much with this input. A great software engineer can in one hour create the same amount of value that a decent engineer creates in one day.
* Once you start studying on your own—out of pure curiosity—you will notice a big difference in the way you understand and retain new information.
* use boredom as your natural content filter, allowing yourself to only study what you are naturally interested in.
* Protect your intellectual curiosity at all costs because it is one of your most important assets.
