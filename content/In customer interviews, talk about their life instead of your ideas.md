title: In customer interviews, talk about their life instead of your ideas
---

When you're trying to evaluate a problem ([["Evaluate", not "validate"]]) by talking to customers, it's too easy to ask bad questions and get bad/misleading data.

There are some rules of thumb to uncover the truth about a problem:
- Talk about their lives. Avoid talking about your ideas.
- Ask about specific behaviors in the past. Don't discuss hypothetical future behavior.
	- Because people are notoriously bad at predicting their future behavior. Past behavior is more indicative of what they might actually do in the future.
	- Talk about the last time they encountered a problem and how they tried to solve.
- Listen more than you talk.
