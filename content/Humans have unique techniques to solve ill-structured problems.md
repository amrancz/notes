title: Humans have unique techniques to solve ill-structured problems

Humans have unique techniques to solve ill-structured problems. (see [[Ill-structured vs. well-structured problems]]):

- Acting on an informed hunch (making very quick decisions)
- Making a judgement
- Using incomplete information
- Breaking out of constraints (when making no progress)

These are very hard/impossible for a computer to do. They are uniquely human.
