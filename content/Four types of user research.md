title: Four types of user research
---

We can identify four types of user research:

1) Strategic research
	- Generative, informs long-term strategy, is about discovering problems and defining them.
	- Enables deliverables like user journey maps, personas, mental models.
2) Concept research
	- Used for testing concepts and decide on a direction for an initiative.
3) Evaluative research
	- Testing specific designs to prove or disprove assumptions. Typically [[Usability testing]].
4) Maintenance research
	- Monitoring feedback/usage on existing solutions.
	- Informs if further work is needed or if the solution hits success criteria.

Note: The way concept research is described by the author is a bit more high-level than how we've been doing concept testing at PB (which is more at evaluative level)
