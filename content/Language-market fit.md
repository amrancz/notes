title: Language-market fit
---

Language-market fit is a concept of matching how you talk about your product to how customers think about the problems they need to solve.

The language you use must match what customers are thinking about in order for them to consider your solution or generally convert.

The concept of [[Goal-directed vs. stimulus-driven attention]] is very important for this.

The best way to achieve language-market fit is to do research, talk to customers, and understand their anxieties, fears, doubts, hopes, dreams and struggles. Then speak to those in your marketing copy.

Essentially, we want our copy to speak to customers' [[jobs-to-be-done]]. It should express the progress customers want to make.
