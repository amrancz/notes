title: Plurality of perspectives create better understanding
---

Any given metaphor/analogy/lens/perspective only trigger a certain, limited set of associations. It can be still useful, but using only one can be misleading ([[Metaphors can be a double-edged sword]]). *One map doesn't completely capture a teritorry.*

And this is especially true for complex things: [[Metaphor usefulness declines with concept complexity]]

Therefore, it is advisable to look at information through many different lenses/perspectives by using different analogies and metaphors.

Bringing in more metaphors also makes understanding of a thing more accessible as it creates more opportunities for people to connect a concept to what they already know (and "what they already know" can vary between people!).
