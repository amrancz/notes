title: My Digital Garden
---

Hi, I'm Adam Amran ðŸ‘‹

This is my digital garden â€“ a place for my notes and thoughts.
I'm building and cultivating this place step by step. Feel free to explore.

There's no fixed structure, the system is associative. Just like our brains!

Best places to start exploring is:
- [[$Recent thoughts and notes]]
- [[$Areas of interest]]
- [[$Book notes]]

This is heavily inspired by Andy Matuschak's [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) and the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/).

The site is built with Gatsby and the [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy).
