title: Product trios should do customer interviews together
---

In empowered teams, the customer knowledge or the "voice of the customer" shouldn't be a monopoly of one person. That gives them too much decision power.

The whole product trio (PM, PD, ENG) should interview together to distribute that knowledge.

Only when the whole trio has the right customer knowledge, can they best collaborate on solutions: [[Best solutions come from collaboration in strong product teams]]

Diverse trios also bring more perspectives and are able to take different but valid things out of interviews.
