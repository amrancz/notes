title: Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD)
---

"Jobs theory" developed by Clayton Christensen aims to describe why do customers do that they do.
They "hire" products and services to do a "job" for them.

"Job-to-be-done" (JTBD) is here meant as a desire to make progress under current circumstances. It's not a mere activity, use-case etc. (though in other interpretations of this framework, the term is often used as that).

Jobs theory describes why do people use seemingly unrelated products/services to satisfy their needs.

In [[user research]] and [[customer interviews]], we typically want to uncover JTBDs because they represent the best opportunities for innovation.

Also, [[Jobs to be done are relatively stable over time]]
