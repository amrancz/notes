title: Availability heuristic
---

Tendency to overvalue or rely more on information that is easily available to us (e.g. easy to remember).
In every day life, the example of this bias might be people considering air-travel more dangerous when there's been reports of accidents recently in the news.

In the context of [[Circular process of writing]], this bias is avoided when coming up with topics to write about because we don't rely on our minds, rather on [[Zettelkasten]] and connections within it for topics to emerge.
