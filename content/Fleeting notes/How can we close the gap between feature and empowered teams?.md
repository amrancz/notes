How can we close the gap between feature and empowered teams?

Why is there the difference between them in the first place? Why are not all teams empowered?

Companies who work in the feature team model have not trully embraced the role and importance of technology. They haven't understood that technology is the business now. The leadership of those companies don't see them as technology companies but rather as (insert whatever industry) company.

The leadership of such companies does appreciate what innovavite companies like Netflix or Tesla are doing, but fail to see how the lessons can be applied to their business.

In some cases, it may be the fear of technology that's behind resistance to a fundamental change.

Ultimately, the leadership must understand the role of technology for the company to move toward the empowered model.
