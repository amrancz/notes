Sometimes, the risk in building something isn't on the customer/market side but on the product side.

This means that the customer/market need is clear but it's unclear whether your product can support it.

Product risk: Can we build this? Can we grow it? Will they keep using it?
Market risk: Do they need it? Will they pay? Are there enough of them?

E.g. a customer will always want more traffic if you're able to generate it. But are you?
Or e.g. video games. That's established that people like to have fun and play games. No need to re-discover that desire.
