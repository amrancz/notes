Tanner Christensen puts out the term "product narrative" in his article https://tannerchristensen.com/blog/2021/1/6/design-requires-product-narrative

Designers (but also product teams as a whole?) have to look beyond features and patterns and lower-level stuff like that. They need to think about how their work contributes to the larger whole. Only then is it possible to create something that helps people do the jobs they need (-> *think about how does this relate to JTBD theory?*)

That's what the product narrative (as in "the story we tell ourselves about the product" or "how we talk about the proudct") is for.

Christensen fails to provide an example of such narrative. Various artifacts like user experience maps, personas and storyboards can inform the creation of such narrative.

The purpose is essentially two-fold:
- Enable teams to focus on the job-to-be-done rather than fixate on the feature or product area too much (related to [[Outcomes over outputs]] ??)
- Align different teams under a single narrative -> If this is the purpose, how does this term differ from "product vision" [[Product vision describes the aspirational future state of a product]]
