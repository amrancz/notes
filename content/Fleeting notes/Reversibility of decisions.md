Research by Lottie Bullens et al. (University of Amswerdam) found that when people view decisions as reversible, they think about them more critically even after the decision is made. They notice their negatives and consider positives of alternatives. They're open to being wrong. 

When people view decisions as irreversible, they tend to focus on its positives and on the negatives of the alternatives â€“ we try to confirm to ourselves we made the right decision.

When we want to stay open to being wrong, it's important that we try to view decisions are reversible. Or make them actually reversible.

This can also help us avoid [[Confirmation bias]].
