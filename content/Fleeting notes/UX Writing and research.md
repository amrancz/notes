	1. Having some principles helps tell better stories
	2. Principles from PB:
		1. "Clarity above all else"
		2. Offer the "why" (reasons and benefits)
		3. Less is more...usually. (Be concise but sometimes more words help clarity or inject tone of voice)
		4. Don't repeat yourself, add value instead.
		5. Think holistically, consider the bigger picture and any connections.
		6. Be helpful, guide users.
		7. Anticipate concerns and address them in design/copy
6. Voice vs. tone
	1. Voice = personality
	2. Tone = adjustments in language based on audience and situation
