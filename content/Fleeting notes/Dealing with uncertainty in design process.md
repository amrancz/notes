Designers need to "work with uncertainty without being paralyzed by hesitation".

As designers/teams go through the process and develop solutions, their understanding and problem definition also evolve. This often leads to a point where they don't know how to proceed.

With growing uncertainty, there's less confidence in one's skills and known procedures.

Uncertain typically grows in non-routine situations â€“ situations to which standard process or skills cannot be applied to achieve predictable outcome.
