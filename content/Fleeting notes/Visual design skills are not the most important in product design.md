Companies often turn down designers for their lack of visual design skills.
In reality, visual design skills are only the tip of the iceberg. Designs very often inherit existing visual language or design systems and have to work with it. They don't have complete power of how the product looks like.

Being able to effectively collaborate in a team and make tough product decisions is more important than creating aesthetic visual design.
