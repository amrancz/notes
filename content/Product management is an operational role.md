Product management is about collaboration and coordination of efforts. [[Product manager's job is to decide what to build next]] and then help everyone in the organization get it done and to the customers succesfully.

As a cross-functional role, it benefits from having previous experience from adjacent roles (design, engineering, sales, marketing).
