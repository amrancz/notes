title: Escalation of commitment
---

Cognitive bias where the more you invest in something, the more commited you are to it.

It's the idea behind persuasion principle of "commitment and consistency" – people are more likely to follow-through with something they already invested in.

In context of design, it's vital to generate many solution ideas. If we have just one idea, we are susceptible to become very invested in it. 

Together with [[Confirmation bias]], this is what often leads teams to build the wrong solutions.

Note: What's the difference between this and Sunk-cost fallacy? Different names for the same thing?
