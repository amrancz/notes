title: Product discovery
---

Product discovery is a process in product development designed to mitigate the [[Four product risks]].

It's about figuring out what exactly the team should build so that it's valuable, usable, feasible and viable for the business.

Discovery is important because [[Product teams have to solve problems, not just deliver features]]. It's a way of making sure the team is actually solving a problem, delivering some value.

It usually runs in parallel with product deliery (when teams actually build the feature/product).

During discovery, teams work together to understand customers, uncover needs, discover product ideas (solutions), prototype them and test them.
