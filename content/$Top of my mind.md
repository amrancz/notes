title: Top of my mind

Here are things that are on top of my mind:
- [[Building the right thing is a foundation of good design]]
- [[People usually to speak about problems in terms of solutions]]
- [[Trying to achieve immediately intuitive UI is problematic in complex products]]
- [[Old designs do not become obsolete with new technologies]]
