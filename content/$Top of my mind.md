Here are things that are on top of my mind:
- [[Visual representations trigger associations]]
- [[Serious thinking requires external structure to support it]]
- [[Associations between concepts is thinking]]
- [[Building the right thing is a foundation of good design]]
- [[People tend to speak about problems in terms of solutions]]
