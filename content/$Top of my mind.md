title: Top of my mind
---

Here are things that are on top of my mind:
- [[Product manager's job is to decide what to build next]]
- [["Evaluate", not "validate"]]
- [[Interaction is part of thinking]] & [[Placing objects in space reflects our understanding of a given concept]]
- [[Visual representations trigger associations]]
- [[External structures support thinking]]
- [[Associations between concepts is thinking]]
- [[Building the right thing is a foundation of good design]]
- [[People tend to speak about problems in terms of solutions]]
