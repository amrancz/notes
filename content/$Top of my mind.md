title: Top of my mind
---

Here are things that are on top of my mind:
- [[Building the right thing is a foundation of good design]]
- [[People usually to speak about problems in terms of solutions]]
- [[Product teams have to understand the business context in order to best solve problems for the business autonomously]]
- [[Trying to achieve immediately intuitive UI is problematic in complex products]]
