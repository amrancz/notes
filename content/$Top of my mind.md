Here are things that are on top of my mind:
- [[Language-market fit]]
- [[Design synthesis]]
- [[Curse of knowledge]]
- [[Building the right thing is a foundation of good design]]
- [[Product manager's job is to decide what to build next]]
- [["Evaluate", not "validate"]]
- [[Visual representations trigger associations]]
- [[Associations between concepts is thinking]]
- [[People tend to speak about problems in terms of solutions]]
