title: Getting good feedback is designer's responsibility
---

When receiving prescriptive or generally unhelpful feedback, designer must dig in deeper to understand what's behind it and get good feedback out of it.

It's an opportunity for the designer to show their expertise and build trust.

Apply curiosity to receiving feedback: seek to understand where people are coming from and their motivations for the given feedback â€“ especially with non-design stakeholders.

Designers should also share necessary context to set up the stage:
- Share what you're trying to solve (goals, objectives)
- Specify what kind of feedback you're after

It's important to avoid the [[Curse of knowledge]] in order to get good feedback.
