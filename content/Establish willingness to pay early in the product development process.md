title: Establish willingness to pay early in the product development process
---

It's crucial to build products around what people are willing to pay for to meet their needs.
In order to do that, you must:
1) talk to customers to learn about their needs or problems to solve -> then [[Segment customers around their needs and WTP]]
2) talk to customers about the price they're willing to pay for a product that addresses their needs or solves their problems

One way of researching willingness to pay is to ask about [[Acceptable-expensive-prohibitive pricing points]].
