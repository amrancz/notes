title: Assign keywords to notes based on the context you're working in or your interests

"In what context do I want to stumble upon this note?" Ask yourself this whenever you are placing a new note into your slip-box. It's a way to [[Connect new notes to existing ones]]

You should always think about the notes in context. Assign keywords based on the context you're working in or your interests.

The best keywords usually require extra thinking â€“ they don't appear explicitly in the note. This is part of elaborating on what you read, therefore quite important.
