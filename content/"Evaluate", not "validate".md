title: Evaluate, not validate, problems/ideas
---

We often say "to validate" a problem or an idea. This language smells of [[Confirmation bias]].

People think associations. (See [[Associations between concepts is thinking]]).
Therefore language matters â€“ different works trigger different associations.

"Validate" evokes confirming what we already believe to be true.
"Evaluate" can prime us be more open to new insights, to being wrong.
