title: Internal distractions are caused by the desire to escape discomfort
---

We're wired to get rid of unpleasant feelings. When we feel discomfort, we want to escape it. This is the root cause of internal distractions

Internal distractions appear when we feel some discomfort and they provide the escape – the trade-off is wasted time.

So if discomfort leads us to waste time, then better time management is basically discomfort/pain management. (see [[Time management is pain management]])
