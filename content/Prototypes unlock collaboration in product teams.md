title: Prototypes unlock collaboration in product teams
---

When designers create prototypes, it enables the whole product team to gather around it and collaborate on the solution.

Prototypes help engineers see technical implications and possibilities. It helps the designer imagine the user experience and flow and come up with more ideas. It helps the product manager see any implications and limitations on the business and also any dependencies across the product.

This is another reason why [[Prototyping is one of the key design skills]] as it's one of the biggest value-adds that designers can bring to product teams.

Prototypes also enable teams to [[Validate ideas with real users and customers]].
