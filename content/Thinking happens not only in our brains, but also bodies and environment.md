title: Thinking happens not only in our brains, but also bodies and environment
---

Anderson and Fast argue in their book that "understanding is a function of brain, body and environment". We don't think exclusively in the brain (the "brainbound model") but also through our bodies and anything in the world (the "extended view" or also [[Embodied cognition]]).

We use not just our brain, but also our bodies and environment to think (and do so better, faster, more efficiently).

This leads to the idea that [[Serious thinking requires external structure to support it]]
