- The book is about learning how people make sense of things. The main question this book answers is: **How do we enable us and others undersand/make sense of confusing information?**

- Understanding happens through 3 key components:
	- associations
	- visual representations
	- interactions (with information)
- Actively working with information is necessary to create understanding. Just having access to the information is not enough.
