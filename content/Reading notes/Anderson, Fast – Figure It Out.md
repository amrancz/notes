- The book is about learning how people make sense of things. The main question this book answers is: **How do we enable us and others understand/make sense of confusing information?**
- Understanding doesn't happen only in the brain but also in the body and environment (Understanding is the function of brain, body and environment)

- Understanding happens through 3 key components:
	- associations
	- visual representations
	- interactions (with information)
- Actively working with information is necessary to create understanding. Just having access to the information is not enough.
- [[Understanding requires more work than passive consumption of information]]

- Our bodies modify and transform our preceptions. 
- We think by doing. [[Action isn't a result of thinking. It's a medium for thinking.]]
- Physical actions influence our ability to understand information.

Some help us understand, others might lead to false assumptions and incorrect reasoning. In those cases, we can react by several things:
- Use first principles thinking.
