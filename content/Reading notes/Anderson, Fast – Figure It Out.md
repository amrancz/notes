- The book is about learning how people make sense of things. The main question this book answers is: **How do we enable us and others understand/make sense of confusing information?**
- Understanding doesn't happen only in the brain but also in the body and environment (Understanding is the function of brain, body and environment)

- Understanding happens through 3 key components:
	- associations
	- visual representations
	- interactions (with information)
- Actively working with information is necessary to create understanding. Just having access to the information is not enough.
- [[Understanding requires more work than passive consumption of information]]

- Our bodies modify and transform our preceptions. 
- We think by doing. [[Action isn't a result of thinking. It's a medium for thinking.]]
- Physical actions influence our ability to understand information.


#### Caution about using metaphors and analogies
Associations can lead us to better understand something unknown but they can also lead us astray. Nothing has one perfect metaphor or analogy. Different metaphors trigger different associations. Some help us understand, others might lead to false assumptions and incorrect reasoning. In those cases, we can react by several things:
- Use first principles thinking. 


### Visual properties (ch. 7)
- Some visual properties are better suited to represent generic information (e.g. color intensity or size/area for getting a general sense of something) than precise, quantitative information (e.g. length or spatial position for precisely comparing information)
- Be mindful of what visual element you use based on what exactly you need to communicate.
	- See [[Pre-attentive visual property]] for more
- For showing sequence, these properties can be useful: Scale (size), Color intensity, line thickness and orientation.
- Be mindful of the scalability of the used property: e.g. it's difficult to discern between 10 line widths vs. just 3; might be easier with color intensity
