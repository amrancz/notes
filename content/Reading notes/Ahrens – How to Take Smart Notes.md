## Introduction

Writing starts much earlier than "the blank screen".
Note-taking is actually the biggest part of the writing process.

This book is about **creating an external system for thinking in** that serves the purpose of writing in more volume and quality.

This system is basically Niklas Luhmann's "[[Zettelkasten]]" (slip-box).
The idea of Zettelkasten is to [[Write about what you read]] by Make small notes with one idea per note and [[Connect new notes to existing ones]].

In Zettelkasten, it's best to Separate reading notes from permanent notes.

## Process of writing using the Zettelkasten system

1. Make fleeting notes – whatever interesting idea pops up during your day. Always be ready to write it down (digitally, on a paper, whatever).
2. Make literature notes – [[Write about what you read]]
3. Make permanent notes – one idea per note. Use your own words. Only developed thoughts go here. Only what you really thought about goes here.
4. Look into the system for topics, ideas and discussions on what to write.
5. String ideas together.
6. Write your draft based on the notes you gathered.
7. Edit your draft into the finished piece of writing.
8. Repeat. Profit.

## The 4 underlying principles of note-taking in Zettelkasten system

### Writing as if it's the most important thing

Writing is part of a broad intellectual process. It shouldn't be an isolated task. It's tightly related to reading, note-taking, learning and understanding.
When you [[Write about what you read]], you enable better learning and understanding. That mostly happens through [[note-taking]] which is just one type of writing.
And writing creates reading for others.
All of this means that Writing is a compounding process. It compounds learning and understanding. Not just for you but for others as well when they get to read what you write.
Parts of the process build on top of each other. It compounds on a personal-level as well as on peer- and society-level.

### Simplicity is essential
It's important to distinguish between three types of notes:
- fleeting
- permanent
- project-related

(Unsure where literature notes fall into here. Same level as fleeting?)

### Nobody ever starts from scratch
Writing is not a linear process. Deciding on a topic, then doing research and then writing, doesn't really work.

Ideas for what to write about should emerge from clusters of notes that you made while you were reading and thinking.

A good sign of embracing a circular process to writing instead of the linear one, is that you will have too many ideas for topics instead of too little.

That's because you reached a critical mass of notes where topics, questions and arguments arise. You can just follow whatever is the most interesting for you at the moment.

The process of writing (in a sense of producing an article/paper/book) becomes much easier because you already have a lot of material to work with and you just pick a topic that is the most interesting.

### The system propels itself forward
Zettelkasten is about creating positive feedback loops in the system. By embracing the [[Circular process of writing]] (making notes, coming back to them and writing on top of them), you create more opportunities for feedback.

Writing permanent notes forces you to check you understanding – otherwise you aren't able to write down notes in your own words.

Better understanding enables to learn more quickly and read more efficiently.
Reading more = making more notes, growing your zettelkasten.

The bigger the system, the more connections it has and the more ideas can emerge from it. The easier it becomes to add new ideas to it – there are more options to connect new ideas to.

These positive feedback loops are crucial for creating motivation to do all of that work.

- Exergonic vs endergonic reactions: Exergonic requires adding more energy to keep going. Endergonic create energy inside to keep going.
	- Working with Zettelkasten is inherently an endergonic process.

In this way, [[Taking smart notes creates a positive feedback loop in the writing process]].

## Learning by reading

- [[Actively working with information enables learning]]
- The ability to think of the information you read is very important. You should be able to think about it in broader context and how it relates to other contexts as well. That's why making connections between notes in ZK is important.
