## Introduction

Writing starts much earlier than "the blank screen".
Note-taking is actually the biggest part of the writing process.

This book is about **creating an external system for thinking in** that serves the purpose of writing in more volume and quality.

This system is basically Niklas Luhmann's "Zettelkasten" (slip-box).
The idea of Zettelkasten is to [[Write about what you read]] by Make small notes with one idea per note and [[Connect new notes to existing ones]].

In Zettelkasten, it's best to Separate reading notes from permanent notes.

## Process of writing using the Zettelkasten system

1. Make fleeting notes – whatever interesting idea pops up during your day. Always be ready to write it down (digitally, on a paper, whatever).
2. Make literature notes – [[Write about what you read]]
3. Make permanent notes – one idea per note. Use your own words. Only developed thoughts go here. Only what you really thought about goes here.
4. Look into the system for topics, ideas and discussions on what to write.
5. String ideas together.
6. Write your draft based on the notes you gathered.
7. Edit your draft into the finished piece of writing.
8. Repeat. Profit.
