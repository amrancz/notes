title: Exposing the Magic of Design – Jon Kolko

- Design synthesis – the process of making sense of design-problem-related input (brief, research data etc.) that leads to ultimately producing a design output (idea, concept, artifact)
- In the design practice, the process of design synthesis is often implicit and not (well) documented.
	- This leads to stakeholders discounting the value of research. Because they don't see how it connects to the output, so they assume it's not necessary.
	- The more innovative the design is, the more this issue is compouned.
- Designers need a set of applicable synthesis methods to make that part of the process more explicit.


- "Problem solving is ultimately a process of decision making" (i.e. I make a series of decisions in order to solve a problem).
	- Kolko references Herb Simon's work in this area.
- Most design problems are ill-structured. They lack a set of predictable steps that lead to solving them. They require some very human techniques for solving: acting on an informed hunch, making a judgement, using incomplete information and breaking out of constraints.
