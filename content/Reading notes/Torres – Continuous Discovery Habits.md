### Discovery vs. delivery

Product discovery – set of activities to decide what to build
Product delivery – set of activities to build and deliver it

Many teams do discovery only ad-hoc, quarterly or monthly. It's better to do it weekly so that there's continuous input from customers that teams can use in their daily product decisions.

Co-creating with customers early on > Validating your assumptions at the end of discovery

"Create value for customers in a way that creates value for the business"

### Part 1: Common framework for discovery (aka Theory intro to Opportunity solution trees)

- Outcomes > Outputs
- Teams should focus on outcomes. Businesses should task teams with outcomes, not outputs.
- It's important not to drive business value at the cost of customer value. Balance is needed here.
- Product trios need to discover customer needs, pains and desires, that addressed, will drive the outcome the team seeks.
- Torres calls customer needs, pains and desires collectively "opportunities".
	- She specifically doesn't call those "problem to solve" to be inclusive of products and solutions that address desires, not necessarily fix problems.
	- So she says "opportunity space" which covers problem space and desire space.
- Discovering a solution to drive an outcome is an ill-structured problem. "How we frame an ill-structured problem impacts how we might solve it."
- Discovery has a structure that teams should map out: 1) define an outcome, 2) discover opportunities, 3) discovery solutions to each opportunity, 4) test assumptions (e.g. solution X will address opportunity Y)
	- She proposes "opportunity solution tree" as a framework to visualise and map the discovery. In her words it's "a simple way of visually representing the paths you might take to reach a desired outcome"
	- The outcome anchor is key because it filters which opportunities we should consider: we might discovery many, but should only consider those that have the potential to drive the desired outcome.
- The OST helps team adopt a continuous mindset by breaking down big opportunities into smaller ones. Teams can then more easily and continuously address those smaller opportunities. By doing so, they address the bigger one over time.
- "The best designers evolve the problem space and the solution space together." The two spaces shouldn't be separate, certainly not by role (e.g. PM owning problem, DES owning solution). All roles in a product trio should be learning together, frame the problem and participate in finding the solution. It just might be that the designer facilitates it and then develops the solution more deeply.
- After testing a solution, we need to reflect. If it didn't work, how does it change our understanding of the opportunity?
- OSTs should evolve continuously as teams progress with discovering opportunities, finding solutions and testing them. Best teams also work bottom-up to reflect how the tests and more interviews change the higher parts of the tree.


### Part 2: Continuous Discovery Habits

11 habits for continuous discovery:

- Managing by outcomes
	- There are different kinds of outcomes: business vs product vs traction metrics
		- Business outcomes tend to be lagging indicators: e.g. growing revenue or customer retention
		- Product outcomes can be leading indicators for the business outcomes: it measures how well the product moves the business outcomes.
		- Product teams (trios) will generally do better to pursue product outcomes. It's more in their control.
		- Assigning product outcomes to product teams gives them more specific responsibility and ownership. With business outcomes, it would be easier to depend on other business functions.
		- Setting and assigning outcomes should be a conversation between product leaders and product trios (note how it's not just the PM!)
			- It can lead to the team being more engaged and perform better when it participates in the outcome setting. (source: Groen B. et al. (2017). "High Job Performance Through Co-Developing Performance Measures With Employees")
		- When given a completely new outcome, first setting a learning goal (e.g. discover opportunities for X), then performance goal (e.g. increase X) – can lead to better performance of the team.
		- Anti-patterns to avoid:
			- Choosing an output as an outcome (e.g. "Launch iOS app" vs. "Increase mobile engagement"). Big no no.
			- Jumping from outcome to outcome, quarter to quarter. Teams need longer time (multiple quarters) to be able to deliver on an outcome. Jumping between outcomes is a sign of fire-fighting culture.
			- Pursuing too many outcomes at ones. Teams need focus.
			- Focusing on one outcome at the cost of everything else.
