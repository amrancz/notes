- Behind every great product is a product manager. PM is the person who leads product teams to build something that's valuable for customers and makes sense for the business.
- Typical product team consists of a PM, product designer and several engineers.
- Companies of different scales are facing different challenges:
	- Startups need to find product-market fit
	- Growth companies strugle with teams not knowing how their work fits/contributes into larger goals and not being empowered/autonomous enough
	- Enterprise companies struggle with innovating. Their teams don't have enough empowerment to bring real innovation. They lack vision (because the founding vision was perhaps achieved)

### Why waterfall doesn't work (aka Root Causes of Product Efforts)
- Sales- or stakeholder-driven ideas are usually not the best for products
- Deciding based on "business cases" (how much will X make vs. how much will it cost), because you cannot know early in the process.
- Many product ideas won't work -> it's not a good idea to build out big product roadmaps based on them. And even if they do, it takes time to develop them: [[Time to money â€“ it typically takes several iterations to develop a product idea enough to deliver the necessary business value]]. 
- PM's job shouldn't be just gathering requirements and documenting them for engineers. [[Product manager's job is to decide what to build next]]. To do their job well, [[Product managers have to have deep knowledge of customers]].
