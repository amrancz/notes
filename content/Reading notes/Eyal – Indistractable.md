- Most distractions start internally – as a psychological discomfort.
- Internal and external triggers can lead to traction (which moves us closer to our goals) or distractions (which moves us away from our goals)

- We bear some responsibility to manage distractions. It's not just up to the medium of the distractions to be responsible for it – e.g. an app or a social network.

- Our behavior is motivated by the desire to escape discomfort/pain. That's the root cause of internal distractions. We get distracted when we want to escape reality.
- To manage our internal distractions, we must understand (and ultimately manage) the discomfort that's causing them.
