- This book describes "bottlenecks" in the way of something reaching receptivity of people to accept it, engage with it or recommend it.
	- Different parts of human psychology act as bottlenecks (filters) that filter out a lot of things we experience.
	- The bottlenecks are:
		- Attention, Perception, Memory, Disposition, Motivation and Social Influence
- "Just as chemistry is the science behind good cooking, psychology is the science behind good design."
- Authors use the term "meme" to describe any piece of information or product that is being "replicated" by people using it.

- Most enterprises don't pass these bottlenecks and die. Only the best survive. This principle of evolution applies to digital products. Almost every category of human enterprise has a phase of "rapid establishement and later decimation."
	- That's when in the beginning, a lot of different ideas and products may be created, but then, most of them die and only a few remain.
- "The memes that are optimized for receptivity will go on to dominate, while those that are misaligned with human nature will be selected against and ultimately go extinct..."
