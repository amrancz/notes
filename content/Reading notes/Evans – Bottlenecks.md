### Introduction

- This book describes "bottlenecks" in the way of a "meme" (information, idea, feature, product) reaching receptivity of people to accept it, engage with it or recommend it.
	- Different parts of human psychology act as bottlenecks (filters) that filter out a lot of things we experience.
	- The bottlenecks are:
		- Attention, Perception, Memory, Disposition, Motivation and Social Influence
- "Just as chemistry is the science behind good cooking, psychology is the science behind good design."
- Authors use the term "meme" to describe any piece of information or product that is being "replicated" by people using it.

- Most enterprises don't pass these bottlenecks and die. Only the best survive. This principle of evolution applies to digital products. Almost every category of human enterprise has a phase of "rapid establishement and later decimation."
	- That's when in the beginning, a lot of different ideas and products may be created, but then, most of them die and only a few remain.
- "The memes that are optimized for receptivity will go on to dominate, while those that are misaligned with human nature will be selected against and ultimately go extinct..."


### Part 3 – Memory
There are three types of memory:
- iconic/sensory – large capacity
- working - very low capacity
- long-term - large capacity

"Forgetting" something is a misleading term, especially in the case of working memory. "Unencoded" is more accurate.

"We can remember forever what we don't forget in a minute."
 
#### Working memory
- Working memory decays rapidly – we lose the information there in ~30sec unless we actively work to keep them available.
	- This trait is an issue in UX design when the user has to carry over some information from one part of the product to another.
	- Designers should ask "What information are we asking users to keep in their working memory, and how can we help them keep it from decaying?"
	- People work around this by using "phonological loop" – subvocally repeating the information to keep it from decaying.
	- Good products use their technical memory to free up users' working memory for other things than e.g. remembering a phone number they want to dial.
- Information in working memory are displaced rapidly – when working memory is at its capacity, existing information is pushed out as new information arrives.
	- Displacement is the problem behind distractions – when we e.g. receive a notification, that new information pushes out some of whatever we were storing in our working memory previously. And it's hard to get back to it.
		- We determine if new information is encoded or ignored based on how much signal it has: how much it's related and useful to our current goals or not.
			- In this way, we are active in that process of signal detection.
		- David Green and John Sweet develop this as a "signal detection theory"
		- We adjust our threshold for which information to let in: if we're more receptive, it comes with a cost of dealing with more noise. If we're less receptive, it comes with a cost of missing out on good signals.
		- In the attention economy, it's crucial to be "sending good signals". Attention has a monetary value and is not to be traded away freely (Davenport & Beck, 2002)
		- Ideally, people should be given the opportunity to reduce the amount of noise coming at them (e.g. adjust ads preferences).

- The process of transferring information from working memory to long-term memory is called "encoding". Most information we perceive is lost before it's encoded.
	- Working memory is the true bottleneck in this sense.

- Due to this bottleneck of working memory, multitasking isn't really possible. What we call multitasking is often monotasking with rapid switching.
	- This comes with the switching costs: it takes longer to finish two tasks done simultaneously (switching rapidly) than one after the other (Marois & Ivanoff, 2005, Dux et al, 2006).
- Multitasking is only possible with activities that are well-learned and don't take up much of our working memory when we perform them – they don't need conscious attention. E.g. driving a car. These are "automatic processes"
	- Automatic processes usually involve movement, while effortful processes involve processing of verbal information and logic.
	- We can perform two automatic processes at once, or one automatic process and one effortful process at once, but not two effortful processes at once.
