title: External structures support thinking
---

Thinking cannot be only a purely internal mental process because of the limitations of the mind. External structures (like [[Zettelkasten]]) are necessary to support serious thinking. They enable to make more meaningful connections and not rely on our ability to retrieve information (which is limited). And because [[Learning best happens by making connections]], this external structure also supports learning.

"*The power of an unaided mind is overrated. Without external aid, memory, though and reasoning are all constrained*." – Don Norman

**Serious thinking requires external structure to support it.**

People naturally extend information onto the external world. We use space to aid understanding. By doing this, we also create something other people can interact with – the benefit of creating external structures to support thinking is multiplied by this. 

"External structures" is part of the idea that [[Thinking happens not only in our brains, but also bodies and environment]].
