title: Research questions are not interview questions
---

Research questions = what you want to learn
Interview questions = what you actually ask

People often make a mistake of taking research questions and asking them directly. That doesn't lead to a good understanding of reality.

When you ask e.g. "How often do you go to the gym?", people won't tell you how often they actually go. They'll tell you how often they think they go or how often want to go. Very different things.

So [[In customer interviews, ask about specific past behaviors]].
