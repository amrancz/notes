title: Goal-directed vs. stimulus-driven attention
---

Matt Lerner in "Finding language/market" fit describes two types of attention:

One is goal-directed, top-down kind of attention. This is when we have a goal in mind and we're looking in our environment for signals that get us closer to it. 

We're essentially pattern-matching information we perceive against what we have in our mind ([[Brain matches sensory information to existing patterns]]). It's called "information foraging" and it's typically pre-conscious (see also [[Preattentive visual property]]). We decide in nanoseconds if something matches what we're looking for.

Stimulus-driven attention is when our mind is more relaxed, looking for things that might catch our attention. It's a more bottoms-up approach.

Goal-directed attention is a crucial concept in finding [[Language-market fit]].

This may roughly correspond to task-positive vs. task-negative neural networks described in [[Evans – Bottlenecks]]. It's possible it's the same thing with different names.
